Participants enrolled in the class each led discussion sections for students taking introductory biology. The discussion leaders were asked to keep track of topics that were difficult for their students. All of the notes were compiled to provide future discussion leaders a list of misconceptions commonly encountered by students taking introductory biology. This list provides class participants a unique look at the problems they may need to address in their respective discussion sections.
